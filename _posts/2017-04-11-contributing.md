As soon as I've made the first feature (sign up flow and sign in + directory component), I'll be open to contributions and ideas from anybody. The code is residing in a private github repo. 

Long term goal of this project is to onboard the existing students within a year, who'd keep the project forward. 

Also, if you are experienced/knowledge savvy Web Developer/Software Engineer, who could guide me/help me, I'd be really happy to get guided. I could be found at arihantverma1994 at gmail dot com
