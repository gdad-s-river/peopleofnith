As soon as I've made the first feature (sign up flow and sign in + directory component), I'll be open to contributions and ideas from anybody. The code is residing in a private github repo. 

Also, if you are experienced Web Developer/Software Engineer, who could guide me/help me. I could be found at arihantverma1994 at gmail dot com
