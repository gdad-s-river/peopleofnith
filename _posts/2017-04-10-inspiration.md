I left my job in January, because of the reasons listed/hinted [here](https://gdad-s-river.github.io/blog/goodbye-sapient). I thought to myself, that this could be the only chance somebody would ever get, to try hands on this thing. Hence I'm on it! I'm not a smart person, it takes time for me to learn things. But since I've time, I'll have a go at it.

Most of my personal reasons are listed here: 

<div class="container" style="position: relative;
    padding-bottom: 56.25%;
    padding-top: 35px;
    height: 0;
    overflow: hidden;">

  <iframe style="position: absolute;
    top:0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;"
    src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o5n63oGrTOtvvfwV-YVGM-kJDgPGE5lIb4InAKG69ag/pub?embedded=true"></iframe>
</div>
